# Jōdō Groningen website

The [Shintō Musō-ryū Jōdō Groningen](https://jodo-groningen.nl) website is hosted by GitHub Pages. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) compiles the source into a static site with the `github-pages` gem. The site uses four plugins that are GitHub Pages [enables by default](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#plugins):

* [jekyll-default-layout](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-default-layout)
* [jekyll-optional-front-matter](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-optional-front-matter)
* [jekyll-titles-from-headings](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-titles-from-headings)
* [jekyll-relative-links](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links)

[Pages CMS](http://pagescms.org) is configured as an easy way to edit the site metadata, main content, and event list. The [CMS app](https://app.pagescms.org/) is connected to the GitHub repository, allowing the user to edit the website’s content directly on GitHub via a user-friendly interface. The [Pages CMS configuration](https://pagescms.org/docs/configuration/) is setup in the [.pages.yml](.pages.yml) file.
